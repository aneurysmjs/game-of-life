    text: `I am an artist and I\'ve spent most of my life at an easel. Creativity and travel are the sources of my inspiration, I interpret the beauty of the world on canvas. I can write in different techniques and with a variety of materials, but mostly I choose oil. Because oil is a bright and delicious palette of vibrant and non-fading colors. Oil allows you to play not only with color, but also with the volume of strokes. Therefore, the palette knife is my magic wand. I once bought it "just to try" and fell in love forever. \n<span style="text-indent: 30px; display: inline-block">Since childhood, I have studied art history from beautiful books, in museums, in art schools and at the institute. Impressionists and Expressionists have occupied a solid niche in my heart. These artists had a huge influence in my formation with their courage, love of life and light.<span /> 
    \n\n <span style="text-indent: 30px; display: inline-block">Welcome to my world of light and shadow, bright contrasts and saturated colors!<span />`,
